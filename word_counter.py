#For this programming challenge, write a function in a .py file which takes 1 string as an argument,
# finds out the number of words in that string, then returns that number. 
#For example, if the program was used on the string "This is a string.", then the function would return 4.

saute it. Dey's uh, shrimp-kabobs, shrimp creole, shrimp gumbo. Pan fried, deep fried, stir-fried. There's pineapple \
shrimp, lemon shrimp, coconut shrimp, pepper shrimp, shrimp soup, shrimp stew, shrimp salad, shrimp and potatoes, \
shrimp burger, shrimp sandwich. That- that's about it."
